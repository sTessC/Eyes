# Eyes

This is an exercise I completed as an assignment for the MIT- xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohert. This exercise includes a web-page where two eyes move around to follow the cursor.

To run this project, download the files included and save them all in the same path on your machine. Run the html in your browser.

Next in this repository, I would like to add code for one eye to follow the cursor, while the other moves away from the cursor.
